# Movie App

Movies have the power to move us like nothing else, whether they are funny, scary, dramatic, romantic, or somewhere in between. So many titles, so much to discover. However, sometimes it is difficult to obtain some movies and nowadays theyâ€™re quite expensive. The purpose of our native Android app is to sell various movies, at a discounted price depending on the year release. All the movies featured in our application will be available to the user to download via the app. The app will initially have 5 different genres, comedy, sci-fi, thriller, action and romance. Each genre has at least ten unique items.
